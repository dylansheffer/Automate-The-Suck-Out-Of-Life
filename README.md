Hey dipshits, this is a personal set of APIs that make my life more convenient because **I WANT TO AUTOMATE THE SUCK OUT OF LIFE**!

## What the hell is this?

This is a chaotic mess of code that does one thing: it makes the things that suck go away so I don't have to deal with them. Is it well-organized? Hell no! Is it built for longevity? Nope! But you know what? It works, and a computer wrote it for me, so I don't give a rat's ass.

## What does it do?

1. **Summary Bot**: 
   - Feed it a YouTube video
   - Get a detailed note about it
   - Boom! Now you know what it's about without wasting your precious time watching cat videos

2. **Obsidian Vault Integration**:
   - Embeds the video in the summary
   - Dumps it into your Obsidian vault
   - Now you look smart with all these "notes" you've "taken"

3. **Hot Takes Generator**:
   - Spew your half-baked thoughts about a video
   - This bad boy compares it with the transcript
   - Spits out a semi-coherent position on the media
   - New ideas! Reflection! All without actually thinking!

## How to use this shit

1. Clone this repo (if you can figure out how, you smoothbrain)
2. Set up your environment (good luck with that)
3. Run `app.py` to start the local server
4. Use the endpoints in `api.py` to do your bidding

## Endpoints

- `/full_process`: Give it a YouTube URL, get a summary
- `/generate_follow_up`: Feed it your brain farts, get structured thoughts

## Is it perfect?

No, it's a beautiful disaster. But it works for me, and that's all that matters. If you don't like it, make your own damn summarizer!

Remember, kids: Why do something yourself when you can make AI do it for you? Now go forth and automate the suck out of your life! üñïüî•üî•üî•


## The Ultimate Goal: API on Unraid, Baby!

Listen up, you absolute troglodytes! The endgame here isn't just to have this pile of code sitting on my local machine like some digital paperweight. Oh no, we're going big or going home!

The master plan is to turn this beautiful disaster into an API and run it on my Unraid server. Why? Because I'm a goddamn genius, that's why!

### What's the big deal?

1. **24/7 Automation**: 
   - This bad boy will be running non-stop, like my caffeine-addled brain
   - No more waiting for my potato laptop to boot up
   - Instant gratification, bitches!

2. **Remote Access**:
   - Access my YouTube summaries from anywhere
   - Beach? Summarize. Toilet? Summarize. Grandma's funeral? You bet your ass I'm summarizing!

3. **Scale This Shit Up**:
   - More power = More summaries
   - Why watch one video when I can have AI watch hundreds?
   - Knowledge stonks only go up! üìà

4. **Integration Heaven**:
   - Hook this API into every damn thing I own
   - Smart fridge? Now it's a smart fridge that knows about quantum physics
   - Alexa? More like "Alexa, give me a summary of that video on nuclear fusion"

### How am I gonna do it?

1. Containerize this mess (Docker, you beautiful bastard)
2. Set up reverse proxy (because security or whatever)
3. Configure Unraid to run the container
4. Profit??? (Or at least save time, same thing)

So there you have it, you mouth-breathers. Soon, this chaotic ball of Python will be a fully-fledged API, running 24/7 on my Unraid server, ready to summarize the living daylights out of any YouTube video I throw at it.

Why? Because I can. And because watching videos is for chumps when you can have AI do it for you.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go yell at my Roomba for not summarizing my floor plan fast enough. Peace out! üñïüî•üî•üî•


## The Road to Unraid Domination: A Chaotic Checklist

Alright, you beautiful disaster enthusiasts! We're about to embark on a journey that'll make your head spin faster than a caffeinated squirrel on a hamster wheel. Here's the game plan for turning this glorious mess into an Unraid-powered, API-slinging, knowledge-spewing wonder:

1. **Containerize This Beauty**
   - Slap this code into a Docker container faster than you can say "What's a Dockerfile?"
   - Make it so airtight, even your most tech-savvy friend can't find a way to break it

2. **Unraid or Bust**
   - We're going rogue! No app store for us, we're keeping it private and mysterious
   - Set up a template for Unraid configuration because we're fancy like that
   - Keep that .env file secret, keep it safe (looking at you, Frodo)

3. **Git Your Act Together**
   - Integrate Git into this containerized masterpiece
   - Pull those Obsidian vaults like you're accessing the Library of Alexandria
   - Multiple vaults? You bet. We're going full galaxy brain here

4. **UI or UI Not, There Is No Try**
   - Ditch Streamlit faster than you'd drop a hot potato
   - Embrace the new hotness: FastHTML (or whatever it's called)
   - Make it so pretty, even your design-savvy friend will be jealous

5. **The Holy Trinity: API, UI, and Brilliance**
   - Combine the API, the UI, and your caffeine-fueled coding into one glorious alliance
   - Make it accessible from anywhere because summarizing videos while skydiving is a basic human right

6. **Security? We've Heard of Her**
   - Set up that reverse proxy like it's guarding the world's last slice of pizza
   - Make it so secure, even you might need to double-check your credentials (it's not paranoia if they're really out to get your summaries)

Remember, this isn't just a project, it's a lifestyle. We're not just summarizing videos, we're revolutionizing laziness. Now go forth and code like the well-caffeinated genius you are! ‚òïÔ∏èüöÄüß†

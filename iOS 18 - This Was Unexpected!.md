## iOS 18 Features and Changes

### Overview of iOS 18 Beta 3
iOS 18 beta 3 was released, bringing various features and changes to test and explore. Though Beta 4 is anticipated to be delayed, this version includes several new elements worth discussing.

### New Unvisible Feature in Xcode Simulator
One notable addition only accessible through the Xcode simulator on a Mac is the Apple Intelligence in Siri's settings. This includes Apple Intelligence's logo and a beta label, hinting at forthcoming features that may be enabled either server-side by Apple or included in future betas.

### Jin Emoji UI Bug
Beta 3 users have reported encountering the Jin Emoji UI when opening their emoji keyboard. Although this bug inhibits interaction, it provides a glimpse of the Jin Emoji feature, which allows users to create emojis based on typed text. This feature is anticipated to be more impactful than initially expected, enhancing text communication with adaptive emoji responses.

### New Features Visible on the Device
Several functional updates are directly visible on devices running Beta 3, including:
- **Lock Screen Customization:** Users can now customize their lock screens more extensively. This includes a new method to eliminate current lock screens and the introduction of dynamic wallpapers that change colors throughout the day.
- **Dynamic Wallpaper:** Wallpapers now have the ability to change colors dynamically over the day.
- **Quick Apple Music Access from Lock Screen:** A new Apple Music shortcut on the lock screen allows users to open the app directly by long-pressing, providing quick music access.

### Control Center Changes
Beta 3 introduces multiple Control Center adjustments:
- **TV Remote Icon Size Adjustment:** The TV remote icon is reduced in size, enhancing visual ergonomics.
- **Personal Hotspot Icon Change:** The hotspot icon's slash line color has been altered from white to gray.
- **Homekit Device Toggle Size Adjustment:** The small square Homekit device toggles are back, offering more convenient use.

### Settings Adjustments
New changes in the settings enrich user experience:
- **Separate Shutdown in General Settings:** "Shutdown" is now a separate section under General settings, previously bundled with iPhone transfer/reset options.
- **Removal of Car Stereo Siri Responses:** The sub-menu for changing Siri response behavior when connected to car stereos or CarPlay has been removed.
- **RCS Messaging Standalone Section:** RCS messaging settings now have their own section, providing users with a simple on/off toggle and a description.

The calculator app has been enhanced with a new "rad" (radius) button, visible in the scientific view. It alternates between displaying radius (rad) and degrees (deg). This change offers clearer option visibility and usability in both scientific and basic calculator modes.

### AirPods Pro 2 Beta Firmware Update
A new beta firmware 75244B for AirPods Pro 2 was rolled out. This update integrates upcoming iOS 18 features, ensuring compatibility and new functionalities in line with OS advances.

### Common Bugs in iOS 18 Beta 3
- **Home Screen Customization Issue:** A bug prevents the customization screen for icons from appearing if using a black background wallpaper. The temporary fix is changing both the wallpaper and home screen setup.
- **Bug in the Tint Feature:** The newly introduced tint feature malfunctions, causing icons to be stuck in a tinted state. This issue mirrors earlier betas and persists.
- **Spotlight Search Keyboard Bug:** A serious bug in Spotlight search causes the keyboard to disappear, with only a reboot solving the problem.
- **RCS Messaging Bug:** RCS messaging erroneously tries to send messages as iMessages in some cases, leading to failed deliveries.
- **Other Minor UI Bugs:** Users reported various interface bugs, including screen whiteouts upon opening apps, necessitating force quits and relaunches.

The performance of Beta 3, as measured by Geekbench, showcases:
- **Single-Core Score:** 2849

The multi-core performance dipped compared to Beta 1, though real-world performance remains stable and improved over beta predecessors.

### Battery Life Assessment

### Challenges in LM Deployment

LM deployment poses a dilemma between choosing high-cost, high-performance models like GPT-4 or opting for cheaper, less capable models such as GPT-3.5. The trade-off lies in balancing the cost and quality of responses generated. Sending queries exclusively to premium models may yield top-tier results but is costly, while routing queries to smaller models saves money but may compromise response quality, as seen with GPT-3.5. This challenge is addressed by LM routing, a method that determines which LM model to send queries to based on cost-effectiveness and response quality. The pivotal role of LM routing is highlighted in reducing costs significantly while still achieving a high level of performance, as evidenced by the project's success in achieving substantial cost reductions across various benchmarks like MMLU and GSM-8K.

# Introduction

Sam greets his friends and acknowledges that he has been absent for a while. He mentions that part of this absence was due to dealing with a medical issue, which he gives a trigger warning for. Sam then announces that he is recovering from cancer. While the term "cancer" initially sounded like bad news, he emphasizes that the word "recovering" has made all the difference.

## Initial Symptoms and Diagnosis

Sam noticed that he couldn't taste sweet foods anymore, which led him to get tested for COVID-19. After testing negative, his doctor suggested visiting an otolaryngologist, a specialist for ear, nose, and throat issues. He was then diagnosed with oropharyngeal carcinoma, commonly known as tonsil cancer, by Dr. Jill Mazza. This diagnosis marked the beginning of Sam's medical journey and his initial reactions to it were understandably distressing.

## Surgery Details

Sam shares his experience about undergoing surgery at USC Keck Medical Center, performed by Dr. Uttam Sinha. The surgery was extensive, involving the removal of his tonsil, a part of his tongue, and a portion of his soft palate. This procedure left him with a prominent 7-inch scar. He describes the aftermath of the surgery as intensely challenging, including a four-day hospital stay where he had to use a feeding tube. He also had to relearn essential functions such as speaking and swallowing, which explains his current slightly slurred diction. Despite these difficulties, Sam emphasizes that the surgery successfully removed the cancer.

### Radiation Treatment

Sam underwent six weeks of radiation therapy administered by Dr. Adam Garsa. This phase of treatment was described as even more challenging than the surgery. He experienced severe side effects, including:

- **Weight Loss**: Sam lost 20 pounds.
- **Loss of Taste**: He was unable to taste food.
- **Radiation Burns**: He suffered burns from the radiation.
- **Difficulty Eating**: Sam found it very difficult to eat during this time.
- **Emotional Distress**: The harsh treatments led him to cry frequently.

Despite these difficulties, Sam expresses happiness and relief about being on the road to recovery.

### Purpose of Sharing the Story

Sam shared his story for three main reasons:

1. **Prevention Awareness**
    - **HPV-Related Cancer**: Sam had tonsil cancer linked to the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), a virus that is extremely common. He shared that:
        - "90% of men and 80% of women" will contract HPV at some point.
        - For most, the virus clears on its own within two years, but for a small group, it can hide in the body for decades and lead to cancers like cervical or tonsil cancer.
        - Sam likely contracted the virus in college without knowing it.
    - **HPV Vaccine**: Vaccines are now available to prevent such cancers. Sam urged:
        - Everyone to ask their doctors about the vaccine.
        - Parents to get their children vaccinated.
        - Adults to consider vaccination up to age 45. 
    - **Vaccine Effectiveness**: Emphasized that with the vaccine:
        - "You get the shot, you don't get the cancer."
        - Encouraged everyone to avoid this preventable and terrible cancer.

2. **Encouragement for Early Detection**
    - **Listening to the Body**: Sam emphasized the importance of paying attention to unusual bodily symptoms.
    - **Examples of Symptoms**:
        - His inability to taste sweet foods led to early detection.
        - Other symptoms may include lumps in the neck, an irritated tonsil, and a nagging sore throat.
    - **Testing for HPV**:
        - Advised getting things checked by a doctor if something feels off.
        - Recommended women and those who get pap smears to ask for testing for HPV.

3. **Gratitude**
    - **Thanking Medical Professionals**:
        - Recognized doctors, nurses, and therapists by name, including Dr. Tamashiro and Dr. Jan.
    - **Appreciation for Friends and Family**:
        - Friends drove him to treatments.
        - His mom stayed with him in the hospital.
        - Special thanks to his sister-in-law, Uyen-Vi, for cooking soup for three months, and friends who sent ice cream, flowers, and gifts.
    - **Deep Gratitude for Immediate Family**:
        - Profoundly thanked his wife and children for their endless patience and support.
